Also it is highly recomended to install and configure [ReSharper C++](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper-cpp/) for overall better code quality. For consistent code it is required to use Microsoft naming conventions. This naming standard can be set from Resharper tool, but can be also followed manually. This naming standard requires to:
