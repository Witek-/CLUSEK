## Redistribution

For easier, consistent and bug-free application redistribution for end-user, the special power shell script can be used. To execute this script you enter below commands in your PowerShell terminal:

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -force
.\Redistribute.ps1
```

This process is very time consuming and on slower machines can take several dozen minutes. This PowerShell script will generate a .zip file with all the required files. This .zip file can be sent to anyone that wants to use this engine without the need of full source code building.
